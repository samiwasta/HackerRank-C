Objective
---------
In this challenge, we will learn some basic concepts of C that will get you started with the language. You will need to use the same syntax to read input and write output in many C challenges. As you work through these problems, review the code stubs to learn about reading from stdin and writing to stdout.

This challenge requires you to print Hello World on a single line, and then print the already provided input string to stdout. If you are not familiar with C, you may want to read about the printf() command.
